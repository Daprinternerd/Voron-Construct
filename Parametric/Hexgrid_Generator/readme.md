## Hexgrid generator 

the image below shows the parameters that you need to adjust to get what you want 

* HexWidth: How wide each hexagon is 
* hexSpacing: the space between each hexagon
* height, width, depth: the size of the finished part , this will generate a rectangle hexagon grid

if you want the hexagons rotated with the flats on top and bottom, you would just swap your width and height param values
