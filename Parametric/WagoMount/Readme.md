This is a Parametric wago mount , 
there are 5 params that you can change to alter it

* WagoSize - This should be 2, 3, or 5
* NumOfWagos - Number of wagos you want to hold 
* ExtrusionSize - 15 or 20 for 1515 or 2020 extrusion 
* MountingScrew - 3 (m3) or 5 (m5)
* TopOrSide - 0 if mounted to extrusion on the side, 1 if mounted down from the top

  there is a check in the parameters, that wont let you do a m5 screw with 1515 extrusion , so if you set 5 for the screw size and then change extrusion to 1515 , it will still use an m3 screw hole
